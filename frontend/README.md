# PhotoLabs REACT Project

PhotoLabs is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that allows users to view photos in different contexts. We used a pre-existing API to build a frontend user experience for users to interact with photos!

## Goal:
Build a client-side application using the React view-layer library.
